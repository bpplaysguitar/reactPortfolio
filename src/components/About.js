        My name is Brian Palay. I'm a full-stack web developer with a
        particular fondness for front-end development and design. I graduated
        from the University of Minnesota with a B.A. in architecture, and I'm
        currently earning a certificate in full-stack development from the University of Minnesota Coding Boot Camp. My work over the years has involved many forms of digital design, including graphic design, product photography, and 3D modeling and rendering.

        I've always loved creating things - from Lego as a kid, to songs in
        my 15 years as a professional musician. In web development, I see a
        new and exciting opportunity to put my passion for creating to work.
