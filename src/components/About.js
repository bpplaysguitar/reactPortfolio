        I’m Brian, and I’m a web developer and UX designer. I strive to provide users with easy and enjoyable experiences through clean, uncluttered design that must first be intuitive before it can be beautiful. I started my design journey with a degree in architecture, then later translated my passion from physical spaces to web applications by earning certificates in UX design from Google, and full-stack web development from the University of Minnesota.
